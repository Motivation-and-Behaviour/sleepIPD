# sleepIPD

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

sleepIPD is an opinionated wrapper around the
[GGIR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR) accelerometer processing
scripts. The wrapper ensures that contributors can reprocess data in
precisely the same way, reducing variations in the data that arise from
different processing decisions. In addition to the reprocessing
functions, sleepIPD also provides a series of helper functions to manage
the reprocessing.
